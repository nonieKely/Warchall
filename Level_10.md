if the file has a kind of ''background'' , it means it is excecutable.
The instruction of the code charp.c says it counts the characters of a file per line.
I wasn't permitted to see what's inside solution.txt so I used the executable program(charp) , I copied what was inside the file I used (solution?txt) and I put it in the tmp/ directory so that
I can read it.
My command was : ./charp " solution.txt | cp solution.txt /tmp/i_found_the_solution.txt"
