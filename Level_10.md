If the file has a kind of ''background'' , it means it is excecutable.
The instruction of the code charp.c says it counts the characters of a file per line.
I wasn't permitted to see what's inside solution.txt so I used the executable program(charp) , I copied what was inside the file I used (solution.txt) and I put it in the tmp/ directory so that I can read it.

My command was : ./charp " solution.txt | cp solution.txt /tmp/i_found_the_solution.txt".
N.B : I didn't have the permission to read solution.txt, but I was able to execute charp , and charp could read solution.txt . That is why i had to execute charp and directly not copy solution.txt
