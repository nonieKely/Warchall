# Chapiter 1 : The beginning
## That was ... pretty easy

- Level 0

Once we find the list of the levels , there is no huge challenge at the first chapiter , that's to say , from level 0 untill 5.
I just had to immediately do 'cd ./../..' so then I can find the home directory
Then 'cat' the file at 00_welcome(that's the first level)

- Level 1

The name of the level is '01_choice_tree'
We can see 3 colours but only the blue color had the ''grey hat'' where the solution was hidden. 

- Level 2

Oooh it seems like there is no file where the solution can be found. Maybe it is hidden. 
Finding an hidden file is so simple : 'ls -a' or if I want to see some more accurate informations : 'ls -al' 
*NB: always without the quote.

But ./.porb doesn't contain anything ... after a seconde ls -a , I've found the solution.


- Level 3

Level 2 and 3 are quite the same. I can find the solution inside ./.bash_History

- Level 4

Once you get back to '~', it is just about authorisation
--> chmdo a+rwx README2.md 
Now the permission is no more denied.


- Level 5 

The rank is so ironic because this is othe easiest level.
I just had to read the README inside the directory to find the 5th solution.
